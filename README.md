## Observation
I observed that the data is an incomplete dataset since there should another dataset that signify the product type and product name and also the data is not well formated for example the data type are all in general(varchar) which means the data needs to well cleaned and some other details are needed to be provided.
Also there lot of empty shells in the dataset especially the state columns(attributes) 
I observed that the sales column shows the sizes of the order made.smallsizes shows sales below 3000 medium denote sales between 3000 to 6999 and large denote 7000
## Report 
The data need to be well cleaned and well formated, the data type, the spaces and the unnecessary column are needed to be removed.
The trends in the year are needed to be analyzed and recorded , the order with the most and the leased ordef sized are needed to reported also the product with the most order ignoring the price of tbe product are needed to recorded too.
